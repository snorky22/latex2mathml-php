- Fixed XML validity in MathML output:
    - Removed `htmlspecialchars_decode` from `Converter::_convert` to ensure that characters like `<`, `>`, and `&` remain correctly escaped as XML entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`).
    - This fixes the "StartTag: invalid element name" and other XML parsing errors in post-processors.
    - Updated `tests/ConverterTest.php` to expect escaped XML entities.

- Improved `check_xml_errors.php`:
    - Now parses the input `.txt` file for individual `<math>` expressions instead of validating the whole file.
    - Outputs a detailed HTML report instead of plain text.
    - Includes statistics (total, valid, invalid counts).
    - Continues processing even if an error is found.
    - Provides specific help/advice for common XML errors (e.g., unescaped characters, tag mismatches).

- Created `check_xml_errors.php`: A utility script to validate the first `.txt` file in the `tests/` directory as XML and report any parsing errors.

- Fixed conversion error for display math containing double brackets `[[...]]` inside LaTeX environments like `equation`.
- Restricted parsing of optional alignment arguments in square brackets to specific environments (array, matrix*, aligned, gathered).

- Created `display_html_math.php`: A new script based on `display_math.php` that:
    - Processes the first `.html` file found in the `tests/` directory.
    - Uses `\(` and `\)` as delimiters for inline math.
    - Uses `\[` and `\]` as delimiters for display math.
    - Maintains support for standard LaTeX environments (e.g., `\begin{equation}`).
    - Uses updated regex for extracting math with the new delimiters.
- Created `tests/test_math.html`: A sample HTML file to test the new script, containing inline and display math using the new delimiters.
- Verified the implementation by running `php display_html_math.php`.
