- Fixed conversion error for display math containing double brackets `[[...]]` inside LaTeX environments like `equation`.
- Restricted parsing of optional alignment arguments in square brackets to specific environments (array, matrix*, aligned, gathered).

- Created `display_html_math.php`: A new script based on `display_math.php` that:
    - Processes the first `.html` file found in the `tests/` directory.
    - Uses `\(` and `\)` as delimiters for inline math.
    - Uses `\[` and `\]` as delimiters for display math.
    - Maintains support for standard LaTeX environments (e.g., `\begin{equation}`).
    - Uses updated regex for extracting math with the new delimiters.
- Created `tests/test_math.html`: A sample HTML file to test the new script, containing inline and display math using the new delimiters.
- Verified the implementation by running `php display_html_math.php`.
